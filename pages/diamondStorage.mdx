# **Storage Layouts**

## **Solidity Storage (Default)**

Stores data in contracts using a numeric address space. 

- The first state variable is stored at position 0
- The next state variable is stored at position 1
- The next state variable is stored at position 2, etc.

### **Solidity Default Layout**
Facets of a diamond share the same storage address space because they read and write state variables to the same Diamond.
As a result, facets of the same diamond need to declare the same state variables in the same order if they are reading and writing to the same locations.
If this is not done properly, issues such as storage clashes could occur.

> Problem Example:
> - Diamond has two facets
>    - FacetA and FacetB
>    - FacetA declares state variables ‘uint first;’ and ‘bytes32 second;’
>    - FacetB declares state variables ‘uint first;’ and ‘string name;’.
>    - Both facets are storing `uint first` at position 0, both facets read and write that variable without problem.
>    - Both facets are writing and reading different variables at position 1 — ‘bytes32 second’ and ‘string name’.
    

## **Diamond Storage**

- Unlike Solidity storage layout, Diamond storage allows you to choose the address space
- Facets specify different locations to start storing data, preventing different facets with different state variables from clashing storage locations.
- This is what **Diamond Storage** does -
    - **Hash of unique string gets random storage position to store a struct**
        - struct contains all of the state variables
        - ‘unique string’ acts as a namespace for particular functionality
    - ***example*:** ***ERC721Facet** implementation*
        - Facet stores a struct called ‘ERC721Storage’ at position *‘keccak256("com.myproject.erc721");’.*
        - struct could contain all the state variables related to ERC721
            - ERC721Facet reads/writes and nothing else

A function signature is the name of a function and its parameter types.

    > Example:
    > `myfunction(uint256)`
<Callout>
    External functions with the same function signature can’t be added to the same diamond.
</Callout>

### **Advantages**

- ERC721Facet is reusable.
- ERC721Facet not cluttered with declarations of variables it does not use

## **App Storage**

- **AppStorage enforces a naming/access convention *makes code more readable and prevents name clashes* of state variables.**
    - The AppStorage struct contains state variables that will be shared between facets.
        - To use it a facet imports the AppStorage struct and declares `AppStorage internal s;` as the Facets first state variable
        - The facet then accesses all state variables in functions via the struct like this: `s.myFirstVariable`, `s.mySecondVariable`
- *‘AppStorage internal s;’* should be declared as the first state variable in all facets using it
    - position 0 in the storage address space allowing storage data to line up between facets
- Add more state variables to the end of the AppStorage struct or use Diamond Storage to avoid address clashing
    - AppStorage can be used with Diamond Storage in the same facet
